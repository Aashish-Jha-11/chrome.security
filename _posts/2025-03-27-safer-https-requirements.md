  Earlier this month, two Chrome Root Program initiatives became required
  practices in the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements (BRs). The
  CA/Browser Forum is a cross-industry group that works together to develop
  minimum requirements for TLS certificates. Ultimately, these new initiatives
  represent an improvement to the security and agility of every TLS connection
  relied upon by Chrome users.
