    <p>Chrome Security’s mission is to make it safe to click on links. We have five focus areas:
    <ul>
      <li>Exploit Defense, which maintains the sandbox, secures process architecture, runs memory safety initiatives, and works to protect Chrome from hackers.</li>
      <li>Transport Security, which maintains the cryptography used by Chrome and secures Chrome’s encrypted network traffic.</li>
      <li>Counter Abuse, which aims to protect users from phishing, malware, and other scams and malicious content.</li>
      <li>Web Security, which works to ensure the core technology of the web is designed with security in mind.</li>
      <li>Bug Response, which ensures bugs in Chrome are found and patched quickly, via fuzzing and the Vulnerability Rewards Program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We provide the building blocks so that all of Chrome is built with security at front of mind.</p>

        <h3>Towards HTTPS by default</h3>
        <p>Wednesday, August 16, 2023</p>
        <p>For the past several years, more than 90% of Chrome users' navigations have been to HTTPS sites, across all major platforms. Thankfully, that means that most traffic is encrypted and authenticated, and thus safe from network attackers. However, a stubborn 5-10% of traffic has remained on HTTP, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or change that data. Chrome shows a warning in the address bar when a connection to a site is not secure, but we believe this is insufficient: not only do many people not notice that warning, but by the time someone notices the warning, the damage may already have been done.</p>

        <h3>Protecting Chrome Traffic with Hybrid Kyber KEM</h3>
        <p>Thursday, August 10, 2023</p>
        <p>Teams across Google are working hard to prepare the web for the migration to quantum-resistant cryptography. Continuing with our strategy for handling this major transition, we are updating technical standards, testing and deploying new quantum-resistant algorithms, and working with the broader ecosystem to help ensure this effort is a success.</p>
