This website is a glorified list of links; a collection of some of the things we've been working on lately; a little home for Chrome Security on the web :)

## How to add a new blog post

Are you a member of Chrome Security who has recently published a blog post? First of all: congrats!

Add your post to our team website by:

1. `git clone` this repo
2. Under the `_posts` directory you'll find `template.md`. Fill in the fields (except `excerpt`, unless you want a custom excerpt).
3. **Save as** with a filename in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD-permalink.md`, where the `YYYY-MM-DD` date is the date of publication, and `permalink` is the permalink string.
4. Convert the body of the blog post to markdown and paste the body of the post under the `---` on line 8. This will be used to generate an excerpt for the link.
5. Save it! Commit it! Bop it! Pull request it!
